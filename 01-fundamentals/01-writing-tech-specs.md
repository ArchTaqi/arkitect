- In Large, structured Organizations: Tech Specs are crucial. They ensure alignment across teams and help mitigate a myriad of risks.
- Smaller features in Structured Environments: for smaller features, wite a simpler version of Tech Specs. These should involve fewer iterations and less detail, customized to fit the project's size.
- Early-Stage Startups: when the team is small and risk is acceptable, you can skipping detailed Tech Specs.

## Three phases approach

- Collect: during this phase all the requirements for the new implementation are collected in the so called **Requirements Document**. This phase is usually led by **product managers** or other stakeholders and itâ€™s crucial. Ideally during this phase a design-first approach should be used and initial designs/wireframes should be included in the Requirements Document. The more comprehensive will be the output of this phase, the easier will be the next phase.
- Assess: here, the engineering team and stakeholders review requirements for clarity and alignment with potential technical solutions. A live Tech Specs draft is created for documenting findings and proposed solutions, with much of the collaboration happening asynchronously.
- Agree: following the output of the previous phase, when the full document is ready, it's time to agree on it and then start the implementation.

## Who Should Write Tech Specs?

Writing Tech Specs is not a solo job; it's a joint effort. While it's fundamental to nominate one person responsible for it at the beginning, there could be many actors involved.

- Tech Leads or Architects: these are experienced engineers who have a broad understanding of the system and can ensure that the Tech Specs align with the overall architecture and long-term vision of the product.
- Product Managers: while they may not write the technical details, product managers often contribute to Tech Specs by ensuring that the specifications align with the product roadmap and customer needs. They can also help define the scope and objectives of the Tech Specs.
- Quality Assurance Engineers: involvement of QA Engineers is crucial to ensure that the Tech Specs include necessary details for testing and quality control.

## Structuring the Document

1. Project Overview: this section should be concise and provide context for the document's readers. It should touch on the problem statement, goals, and non-goals.
2. Proposed Solution: in this section, you should describe how the team intends to solve the problem. It's a high-level description of the solution your team plans to adopt.
3. Alternative Solutions: it's important to list other solutions considered and explain why they were discarded.
4. Implementation: this is the core of the technical document. Here, you can include all technical details related to the implementation, such as the tech stack, database structure, API specs, diagrams, and more.
5. Delivery: this section outlines how you intend to roll out the new feature or project. Include details about deployment, potential roll-back plans, test cases, and more.
6. Success Criteria: measuring the success of a new product feature or project delivery is crucial. In this section, include criteria that could determine this success.
